# Phase 5 Integration Test Plan

## Overview
Phase 5 integrates Twelvelabs AI video analysis with V4's existing media store in parallel operations that don't break existing functionality.

## Key Integration Points

### 1. MediaFile Interface Extensions
- ✅ Added optional Twelvelabs fields to `MediaFile` interface
- ✅ Fields: `twelveLabsVideoId`, `twelveLabsTaskId`, `indexingStatus`, `indexingProgress`, `indexingError`
- ✅ Backward compatible - existing media files work unchanged

### 2. Enhanced addMediaFile Workflow
```
Existing Flow (Preserved):
1. Create MediaFile object with UUID
2. Add to local state immediately (UI responsiveness)
3. Save to persistent storage (IndexedDB + OPFS)
4. If storage fails, remove from local state

New Parallel Operations (Videos Only):
5. Initialize Twelvelabs status fields (pending, 0%)
6. Start background Twelvelabs indexing (non-blocking)
7. Update local state with progress callbacks
8. Persist status to Supabase (parallel background operation)
9. Handle errors gracefully without affecting main flow
```

### 3. Enhanced loadProjectMedia Workflow
```
Existing Flow (Preserved):
1. Load media metadata from IndexedDB
2. Load media files from OPFS
3. Regenerate video thumbnails
4. Update local state

New Parallel Operations:
5. Query Twelvelabs metadata from Supabase
6. Merge status data with media items
7. Update state with restored status
8. Handle errors gracefully (don't fail main load)
```

### 4. Enhanced removeMediaFile Workflow
```
Existing Flow (Preserved):
1. Clear video cache
2. Cleanup object URLs
3. Remove from local state
4. Remove from timeline if referenced
5. Delete from persistent storage

New Cleanup Operation:
6. Delete Twelvelabs metadata from Supabase (videos only)
7. Handle errors gracefully (don't fail main deletion)
```

## Safety Measures

### 1. Non-Breaking Design
- All Twelvelabs fields are optional in MediaFile interface
- Existing media files without Twelvelabs data work unchanged
- V3 features are additive, not replacements

### 2. Error Isolation
- Twelvelabs errors don't break main media workflow
- Storage failures are logged but don't throw
- Background operations use try/catch with graceful fallbacks

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Twelvelabs processing runs in background (non-blocking)
- Only videos trigger AI analysis (images/audio skip)
- Supabase operations are parallel to main storage

### 4. State Management
- Added `updateMediaIndexingStatus` method for clean state updates
- Progress updates use callback system for real-time UI updates
- Status restoration on load maintains consistency

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality (Should Not Break)
- [ ] Add image file to media library
- [ ] Add audio file to media library
- [ ] Add video file to media library
- [ ] Remove media files from library
- [ ] Load project with existing media
- [ ] Timeline operations with media files

### V3 Enhanced Functionality (New Features)
- [ ] Video upload triggers Twelvelabs indexing
- [ ] Indexing status shows in UI (pending → processing → completed)
- [ ] Status persists across page reloads
- [ ] Failed indexing shows error message
- [ ] Non-video files skip Twelvelabs processing

### Error Scenarios (Graceful Degradation)
- [ ] Twelvelabs API unavailable (video still uploads normally)
- [ ] Supabase unavailable (video still uploads normally)
- [ ] Network interruption during indexing (status recovers on reload)
- [ ] Invalid video format (indexing fails gracefully)

## Environment Requirements

### Required for Full Testing
- ✅ Supabase configured with media_twelvelabs table
- ✅ Twelvelabs API key configured
- ✅ Environment variables in .env.local

### Fallback Behavior (Missing Config)
- Videos upload normally to V4 storage
- Twelvelabs fields remain undefined
- No errors thrown or functionality broken

## Integration Success Criteria

1. ✅ Existing media workflow unchanged and unbroken
2. ✅ Videos get enhanced with AI analysis capabilities
3. ✅ Status tracking works across page reloads
4. ✅ Error handling doesn't break main functionality
5. ✅ Performance impact is minimal (background processing)
6. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
